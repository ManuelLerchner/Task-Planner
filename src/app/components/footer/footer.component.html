        In this project, I built a small Task-Tracker website that allows you to
        create Boards and Notes to keep track of your projects and tasks. You
        can drag the Notes around and double-click them to change their color
        alowing you to create different groups.
        <br />
        <br />
        Additionally this website is built as a PWA so you can download the
        website onto your device and use it offline as well.
        <br />
        <br />
        The website was built with Angular, Bootstrap, Font-Awesome and
        Dexie.js.
